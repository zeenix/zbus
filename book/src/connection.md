# Establishing a connection

<!-- toc -->

The first thing you will have to do is to connect to a D-Bus bus or to a D-Bus peer. This is the
entry point of the zbus API.

## Connection to the bus

To connect to the session bus (the *per-user* bus), simply call `Connection::session()`. It
returns an instance of the connection (if all went well). Similarly, to connect to the system bus
(to communicate with services such as [NetworkManager], [BlueZ] or [PID1]), use
`Connection::system()`.

Moreover, it can be converted to a [`MessageStream`] that implements [`futures::stream::Stream`],
which can be used to conveniently receive messages, for the times when low-level API is
more appropriate for your use case.

**Note:** it is common for a D-Bus library to provide a "shared" connection to a bus for a process:
all `session()` share the same underlying connection for example. At the time of this writing,
zbus doesn't do that.

**Note:** on macOS, there is no standard implicit way to connect to a session bus. zbus provides
opt-in compatibility to the Launchd session bus discovery mechanism via the `launchctl getenv` feature.
The official dbus installation method via `Homebrew` provides a session bus installation,
utilizing macOS `LaunchAgents` feature. By default, zbus consumes an address for a bus connection that
is provided via `launchctl getenv DBUS_LAUNCHD_SESSION_BUS_SOCKET` command output.

## Using a custom bus address

You may also specify a custom bus with [`connection::Builder::address`] which takes a D-Bus address
[as specified in the specification][dspec].

## Peer to peer connection

Peer-to-peer connections are bus-less[^bus-less], and the initial handshake protocol is a bit
different. There is the notion of client & server endpoints, but that distinction doesn't matter
once the connection is established (both ends are equal, and can send any messages).

For example to create a bus-less peer-to-peer connection on Unix, you can do:

```rust,noplayground
# #[tokio::main]
# async fn main() -> zbus::Result<()> {
# #[cfg(unix)]
# {
use std::os::unix::net::UnixStream;
use zbus::{connection::Builder, Guid};

let guid = Guid::generate();
let (p0, p1) = UnixStream::pair().unwrap();
# #[allow(unused)]
let (client_conn, server_conn) = futures_util::try_join!(
    // Client
    Builder::unix_stream(p0).p2p().build(),
    // Server
    Builder::unix_stream(p1).server(guid).p2p().build(),
)?;
# }
#
# Ok(())
# }
```

`unix_stream` takes a [`std::os::unix::net::UnixStream`], whichever runtime the connection ends
up on. A stream of another kind is handed over as the socket it wraps: `into_std()` for a
[`tokio::net::UnixStream`].

[`tokio::net::UnixStream`]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/struct.UnixStream.html

**Note:** the `p2p` and `server` methods of `connection::Builder` are only available when `p2p`
cargo feature of `zbus` is enabled.

## Runtimes

zbus ships no async executor and no reactor of its own. A connection takes its readiness
notifications, timers, spawned tasks and blocking work from one runtime, chosen once when it is
built. Its async locks are a separate choice, made by cargo feature: `async-lock` (which the
default `async-io` feature enables) or `tokio`.

### Built-in backends

With the `async-io` cargo feature (a default feature), a connection runs on the `async-io`
backend, unless the `tokio` feature is also enabled and a Tokio runtime is current on the thread
that builds it, in which case it runs on Tokio instead. With only `tokio` enabled, a connection
always runs on the Tokio runtime that is current when it is built; building one from a thread
with no such runtime fails with `Error::Unsupported`.

A build with neither feature depends on no `tokio` crate, and on nothing the `async-io` feature
owns bar one: zbus's own locks come from `async-lock` or from `tokio`, so such a build has to name
one of the two, and `async-lock` is that exception — a crate of locks alone, with no thread and no
reactor of its own. Every connection in the build needs an explicit runtime, given through
[`Builder::runtime`].

### Supplying your own runtime

[`Builder::runtime`] takes any implementation of [`traits::Runtime`], for an application whose
event loop is neither backend above:

```rust,no_run
use zbus::{Connection, Result, connection::Builder, runtime::traits::Runtime};

async fn connect(runtime: impl Runtime) -> Result<Connection> {
    Builder::session().runtime(runtime).build().await
}
```

An implementation supplies readiness for a registered socket or pipe (through
[`PollIo::poll_io`]), a timer, and spawning a future to run in the background. Every zbus
operation goes through these, except a handful of calls that have no async form: the host-name
lookup for a `tcp:` address, reading the file a `nonce-tcp:` address names, the
supplementary-group lookup behind a peer-credential check, and waiting for the helper process of
a `unixexec:`, `ibus:` or `launchd:` address to exit. These go through [`spawn_blocking`], whose
default runs each one on a thread of its own that exits once the call returns; a runtime that
keeps a pool of threads for blocking work should override it to use that pool instead. The wait
for a helper process starts once the connection has let go of the pipe it reads that process's
output from, and occupies a worker until the program is gone: no time at all for one that has
already exited, and until its input ends for a `unixexec:` program that is still running — one
that ignores the end of its input keeps that worker.

zbus's integration tests include a reference runtime: a single-threaded one built on the
`polling` crate, whose run loop drives a connection's readiness, timers and tasks without
starting a thread of its own. The build it runs in enables `async-lock` for zbus's locks.

### Bringing your own socket

Besides an address, a connection can be built directly over a socket you already have.
[`Builder::unix_stream`], [`Builder::tcp_stream`] and [`Builder::vsock_stream`] each take an
owned, platform-native stream and register it on the connection's runtime; a stream of another
kind is handed over as the socket it wraps, such as `into_std()` for a Tokio stream or
`into_inner()` for an `async-io` one. [`Builder::socket`] and [`Builder::authenticated_socket`]
take any other implementation of `Socket`, for a transport that is not a file descriptor at all,
such as an in-process channel.
