//! Compile-only fixture: a downstream crate that only enables the `service` feature of `zbus`,
//! while its build script depends on `zbus` with the `proxy` feature.
//!
//! Cargo unifies the features of host dependencies (build scripts and proc-macros) separately
//! from the target ones, so `zbus_macros` is compiled with `proxy` enabled here even though the
//! `zbus` this crate links against is not. The `proxy` attribute of the `interface` macro must
//! therefore decide on the `zbus` side whether to generate a proxy.
