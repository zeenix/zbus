//! Types for the various [D-Bus bus names][dbn].
//!
//! D-Bus has several kinds of names — unique connection names, well-known service names,
//! interface names, error names, member names and property names — and each kind has its own
//! syntax rules. This module provides a type per kind: a name is validated once, when it is
//! created, and is then known to be valid everywhere it travels.
//!
//! Each type has an owned counterpart ([`OwnedBusName`], [`OwnedInterfaceName`] and so on) for
//! when the borrowed form is inconvenient, and all of them implement [`Type`] and convert to
//! and from [`Value`], so they can be sent over the bus directly.
//!
//! Validation failures are reported as [`crate::Error::InvalidName`], and conversions between
//! two name kinds that cannot succeed as [`crate::Error::InvalidNameConversion`].
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use zbus::names::InterfaceName;
//!
//! let name = InterfaceName::try_from("org.freedesktop.DBus").unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(name, "org.freedesktop.DBus");
//!
//! // An interface name needs at least two elements separated by a dot.
//! InterfaceName::try_from("no-dots").unwrap_err();
//! ```
//!

//! [`Type`]: trait@crate::wire::Type
//! [`Value`]: enum@crate::wire::Value
