//! Who runs a built-in runtime: the thread inside a `block_on`, or a helper thread where no such
//! thread is there to do it.
//!
//! The scheduler and the reactor are run by one thread at a time, the one in the driver's seat.
//! A thread that enters `block_on` takes the seat if it is free and keeps it until its future is
//! done: between two polls of that future it runs a batch of ready tasks and then waits on the
//! reactor, so a program that drives its connections through `block_on` runs them on its own
//! thread and starts none. A thread that finds the seat taken parks instead, to be polled again
//! when its future is woken or the seat is freed.
//!
//! Work that outlives every `block_on` — a connection polled from some other executor, or a
//! task left running once `block_on` has returned — is run by a helper thread, started where
//! that work is found with nobody in the seat, and gone once nothing is left to run, watch or
//! time.
