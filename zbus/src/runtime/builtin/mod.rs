//! The runtime zbus brings along, for a connection that is handed no runtime of its own.
//!
//! It is made of a scheduler, which holds the tasks and hands them out to be polled, a reactor,
//! which watches the sockets and keeps the timers, and a seat, which one thread at a time is
//! in to run the two. Everything [`traits::Runtime`] asks of a runtime reaches one of them: a
//! spawned future is queued on the scheduler, a registered source is the reactor's and so is a
//! timer, from the first poll of it onwards, and blocking work goes to a thread of its own, as
//! the trait's default has it.
//!
//! There is one runtime in a process, shared by every connection built without one of its own,
//! for as long as any of them or a thread running it is alive: one channel for breaking a wait
//! from another thread — a pipe on unix and a socket pair on Windows, two descriptors either
//! way — and no thread until there is work with nobody to run it.
//!
//! The thread in the seat is the one inside [`block_on`](crate::block_on), where a program has
//! one: it runs the tasks and waits on the reactor between two polls of its own future. Where
//! none has — the connection is polled from some other executor, or work is left once
//! `block_on` has returned — a helper thread takes the seat, and leaves in the round it finds
//! nothing left to run, watch or time.
//!
//! A panic in a task is caught and fails that task's handle. A panic outside a task — in a
//! waker, say — unwinds the thread in the seat: out of `block_on`, to whoever called it, with
//! the seat freed on the way; out of the helper's loop, with its flag cleared so that the next
//! spawn, registration or timer poll starts another. A reactor wait takes the ready I/O wakers
//! out of its maps and wakes them, then does the same with the due timers, so a panic partway
//! through waking one of those batches drops the rest of that batch, still unwoken, in the
//! unwind: gone from the maps already, they are not seen again, and the waiters they belonged to
//! stay pending.
//!
//! Nothing here takes a runtime down while it has work: a detached task that never finishes
//! keeps a helper, and everything that task's future holds, for the life of the process.
