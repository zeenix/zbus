//! The wait on Windows: `select` over the sources' sockets and a socket pair that breaks the
//! wait.
//!
//! Winsock asks that all the sockets one `select` is given come from a single service provider,
//! which it settles by the `providerId` of the protocol each of them speaks. The channel that
//! breaks a wait is a loopback TCP connection, and each call puts it in the read set beside the
//! sockets a connection registered, an `AF_UNIX` one among them wherever the bus address is a
//! `unix:path=` one. The runtime's own
//! `an_af_unix_socket_is_watched_beside_the_tcp_wake_socket` is the test that pairs those two
//! families in one wait.
