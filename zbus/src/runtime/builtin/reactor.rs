//! What watches a runtime's sockets and keeps its timers.
//!
//! A reactor holds every source registered on it and every timer taken from it, and a worker
//! thread with nothing left to run hands it that thread through [`Reactor::wait`]: one wait on
//! the platform's poll, bounded by the nearest deadline, and then the wakes for whatever that
//! wait found ready and for whatever timer has come due.
//!
//! The poll is level-triggered, and nothing here arms or disarms a source as readiness comes and
//! goes. Each wait is told afresh what to watch, worked out from the wakers stored for each
//! source, so a source nobody waits for any more is simply left out of the next wait, and one
//! that became ready between two waits is reported by the second. That is also why a waiter which
//! stores a waker breaks the wait under way: that wait was built before the waker existed, and
//! only the wait after it takes the source in.
//!
//! Two locks guard all of this. Where both a source's place in the map and the wakers of that
//! source are needed, the map is taken first and never the other way round; the timers are taken
//! on their own. Neither lock is held across the wait, which may last until a deadline, nor
//! across a wake, which runs a task's code and may come straight back here to register a source,
//! to ask for a timer or to let either go.
