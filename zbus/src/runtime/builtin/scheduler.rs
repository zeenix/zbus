//! The tasks of one runtime, and the queue of those that are ready to be polled.
//!
//! A scheduler holds every task spawned on it and hands them out one at a time to be polled, on
//! whichever thread calls [`Scheduler::run_one`]. It has no thread of its own: the thread
//! running the runtime calls that method for as long as there is anything to run.
//!
//! Every task lives in a cell that holds its future, and each cell with something to do sits in
//! the ready queue. Waking a task, from any thread, puts its cell on that queue and calls the
//! `notify` hook the scheduler was built with, which is how a thread waiting with nothing to do
//! learns that it has a task to poll. A wake for a cell that is already queued, or whose future
//! has gone, does nothing, so a task woken three times is polled once; a wake that arrives while
//! the task is being polled is remembered and queues the cell again once that poll returns.
//!
//! [`Inner::spawn`] hands back a handle that resolves to what the task produced. Dropping
//! the handle cancels the task: the future is dropped there and then if nobody is polling it,
//! and by the poll under way otherwise. A task whose outcome is of no further interest is
//! detached instead, and runs until it ends.
//!
//! A task that panics takes nothing with it. The panic is caught where the task is polled, the
//! task ends there, its handle reports the failure, and the thread that polled it carries on
//! with the next task.
//!
//! A cell's lock guards both what its task is up to and the waker of whoever is joining it — one
//! lock for both, so a poll that has just returned settles both from a single consistent view of
//! the wake, the cancellation and the join that may have arrived while it ran. That lock is
//! always taken before the scheduler's own, never the other way round, and neither is held while
//! a future is polled or dropped, nor while a waker of either kind is woken, because all three
//! run code that may spawn a task, cancel one or wake another on this very scheduler — the
//! destructor of a future is where a connection hands over the last of its work — and that code
//! takes the locks that would be held.
