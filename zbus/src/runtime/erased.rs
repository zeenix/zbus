//! An external runtime, in two layers.
//!
//! [`Builder::runtime`] takes any implementation of the runtime traits and a connection must not
//! be generic over it, so the implementation is boxed once behind the object-safe mirrors of
//! those traits that make up the lower layer here: [`ErasedRuntime`] and one trait per thing a
//! runtime hands out. Everything generic is erased on the way through: what a task produces
//! becomes a `Box<dyn Any + Send>` and a future becomes a trait object of its own.
//!
//! The upper layer puts the public traits back on top of the boxed mirrors: [`ExternalTask`]
//! carries the type of the value again, and [`Arc<dyn ErasedRuntime>`](ErasedRuntime) implements
//! [`traits::Runtime`] itself. That is what lets the rest of the crate treat a runtime it was
//! handed as one more implementation of the traits, reached exactly as the built-in backends are.
//!
//! What the layers cost, all of it on this path alone. A registration costs one allocation and so
//! does a sleep. A spawn costs two, the future and the handle, and a third as the task ends for
//! the value it produced, which a task that produces nothing does not pay. A call to the blocking
//! hook costs three — the work, the value it hands back and the future that downcasts that value
//! — on top of the boxed future the hook returns whichever runtime it is called on.
//!
//! Readiness is mirrored without erasing anything: the operation a registration runs hands its
//! result back through the caller's own captures, so an I/O call costs no allocation here.
//!
