//! A readers-writer lock that a future can hold across an await point.
//!
//! The object server keeps its tree of nodes and the interfaces hanging off it behind one of
//! these: every incoming method call reads the tree to find its target, and adding or removing an
//! object writes it. The guards outlive an await in both directions — an interface's method is a
//! future of its own, and it runs while the guard on that interface is alive — so
//! [`std::sync::RwLock`] cannot serve there: its guards are `!Send`, so a future holding one
//! cannot be spawned on an executor that moves work between threads, and blocking the thread on a
//! contended lock would stall every other future sharing it. Waiting for this lock suspends the
//! future instead and leaves the thread free.
//!
//! The lock is write-preferring: a writer that is waiting holds new readers back, so that a
//! stream of readers cannot starve it. A task already holding a read guard must therefore not ask
//! for a second one, since a writer arriving in between would deadlock it.
