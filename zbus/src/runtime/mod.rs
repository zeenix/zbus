//! Integration with the async runtime that drives a connection.
//!
//! zbus does not ship a runtime of its own. A connection watches its socket, takes its timers,
//! runs its internal tasks and hands off its blocking work on `async-io` (the default), on Tokio,
//! or on any implementation of [`traits::Runtime`] handed to [`Builder::runtime`]. Both built-in
//! backends are implementations of that trait, picked by the `async-io` and `tokio` features. The
//! async locks a connection holds are not part of that trait: they come from `async-lock` or from
//! Tokio, whichever of the `async-lock` and `tokio` cargo features is on.
//! [`AsyncDrop`] is the async counterpart of [`Drop`] that zbus's own types implement.
//!
//! [`Builder::runtime`]: crate::connection::Builder::runtime
