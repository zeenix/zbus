//! Integration with the async runtime that drives a connection.
//!
//! zbus does not ship a runtime of its own. A connection waits for socket readiness and timers,
//! and runs its internal tasks, on `async-io` (the default) or on Tokio, chosen when the
//! connection is built. This module holds what a connection exposes of that choice:
//! [`Executor`] wraps the executor zbus drives for the `async-io` backend (and stands empty
//! when Tokio runs the tasks itself), `Task` is its task handle, and [`AsyncDrop`] is the async
//! counterpart of [`Drop`] that zbus's own types implement.
//!
//! See [`crate::Connection::executor`] for driving a connection from your own runtime.

/// Evaluates the `tokio` or `async-io` expression for the active backend.
///
/// With a single backend it resolves to that backend's expression at compile time; with both it
/// picks at runtime via [`use_tokio`]. The inactive arm is `cfg`-stripped, so each arm only needs
/// to be valid in the configurations where its backend is compiled in.
///
/// The choice is re-evaluated on every call, so this is only safe where it doesn't need to match a
/// particular connection's backend. A connection latches its backend once at build time (see
/// [`Executor::new`]); use that instead of this macro for anything tied to the socket's reactor.
/// The current call sites (timers, the blocking pool) are independent of the socket, so a per-call
/// decision is fine.
