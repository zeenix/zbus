//! The helper process behind a transport.
//!
//! `unixexec:` runs a program and speaks D-Bus over its standard input and output, while `ibus:`
//! and, on macOS, `launchd:` run one to ask it where the bus is. Either way the connection makes
//! the pipes to the program itself and hands the program's ends of them over as its standard
//! streams, along with the command, to the connection's runtime: the runtime spawns the program
//! and gives back the future of its exit status. The connection's own ends of the pipes are
//! watched by that runtime the way its sockets are.
//!
//! The wait for a `unixexec:` program is a task of the runtime, spawned along with the program and
//! left to run on its own, so the program is collected as soon as it exits. The call that runs an
//! `ibus:` or `launchd:` program awaits its exit status itself. Closing a `unixexec:` connection
//! closes the program's input, which is what tells the program to exit. What the runtime does to
//! wait for the program, and what that costs, is the runtime's own: see
//! [`Runtime::spawn_process`].
