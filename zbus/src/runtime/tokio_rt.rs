//! The Tokio backend: Tokio's reactor for readiness, its timer, its tasks, its connects, its child
//! processes and its thread pool for blocking work.
//!
//! A socket or a child process of Tokio's own belongs to the runtime that is current where it is
//! made, and zbus may poll the future of a connect or of a wait from a thread with no Tokio
//! runtime current: a program that drives zbus with an executor of its own does. So the runtime
//! the connection was built on is entered for every poll of a connect and of a wait for a child
//! process, and around the spawn of one, and what they make is that runtime's wherever it is
//! polled from.
//!
//! A connect to a TCP or unix-domain socket is Tokio's own non-blocking connect. It waits on the
//! reactor and so occupies no thread, and the socket comes back as a std one that Tokio no longer
//! watches, for the connection to register for its traffic. Tokio turns a connection to a unix
//! listener whose backlog is full away at once on Linux and Android, where a blocking connect
//! would wait for room, so that connect tries again every 20 milliseconds, on Tokio's timer, for
//! as long as the future is awaited.
//!
//! The socket a connection registers is watched through Tokio's `AsyncFd` on unix. On Windows
//! Tokio watches only the sockets of its own types, each of which owns its socket, so the
//! registration there is a `TcpStream` made from a duplicate of the connection's socket handle.
//! The duplicate refers to the same socket as the handle the connection reads and writes through,
//! and the stream is there to tell when that socket is ready. Tokio has no unix-domain sockets on
//! Windows, and mio, which it watches sockets with, has none either. So a unix-domain connect
//! there is `Unsupported`, and so is the registration of a unix-domain socket.
//!
//! A helper process is spawned by Tokio's own `Command` and waited for by Tokio's reactor, which
//! watches a pidfd on Linux, or by its handler for `SIGCHLD` where there is none. Tokio collects a
//! child whose wait is dropped while the process runs only when its driver next returns from
//! waiting for events, on a best-effort basis, and a runtime with nothing else to wake it, a
//! multi-threaded one that is idle, may not do that for as long as it stays so. zbus awaits the
//! wait on a task of the runtime, so the process is collected as it exits. zbus turns Tokio's
//! `process` feature on only where a transport runs a program, so in any other build the spawn is
//! `Unsupported`, and nothing asks for it.
