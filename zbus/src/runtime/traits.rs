//! What a runtime supplies to a connection.
//!
//! zbus ships no runtime of its own. A connection watches its socket, takes its timers, runs its
//! tasks and hands off its blocking work on `async-io` (the default), on Tokio, or on whatever
//! implements [`Runtime`] and is handed to [`Builder::runtime`]. Implementing the trait takes a
//! readiness registration, a timer and a task handle, all of which every async runtime already
//! has, together with a hook for blocking work. Both built-in backends are implementations of
//! these traits, picked by the `async-io` and `tokio` features.
//!
//! The async locks a connection holds are not part of the trait: zbus takes those from
//! `async-lock` or from Tokio, whichever of the `async-lock` and `tokio` cargo features is on, so
//! a build that runs on a runtime of its own still has to enable one of the two.
//!
