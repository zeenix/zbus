//! What a runtime supplies to a connection.
//!
//! By default, a connection runs on [zruntime] (the `default-rt` feature, on by default):
//! one runtime per thread that runs [`block_on`](crate::block_on), driven by that thread, and by
//! a helper thread only for work left with no thread inside `block_on`. A connection built inside
//! a Tokio runtime runs on it instead (the `tokio` feature), and any other runtime reaches a
//! connection through whatever implements [`Runtime`] and is handed to [`Builder::runtime`].
//! Implementing the trait takes a readiness registration, a timer and a task handle, all of which
//! every async runtime already has, and the connects of TCP and unix-domain sockets and, on unix,
//! the spawn of a child process, which a runtime makes with what it has: a non-blocking connect
//! and a way to wait for a child to exit, or, for whichever of those it lacks, a thread for
//! blocking work. Only the hook for blocking work comes with a default, which a runtime with a
//! pool of threads for blocking work replaces. Both built-in backends are implementations of these
//! traits, and the polling-based runtime in zbus's integration tests is a worked example of the
//! whole contract on a single thread: it connects on its own poller, and waits for a child process
//! by looking at it at an interval on its timer.
//!
//! The async locks a connection holds are not part of the trait: they come from zruntime, so no
//! build needs a feature for them, whichever runtime it runs on, nor pulls in a lock crate of its
//! own. A Tokio build uses Tokio's locks instead.
