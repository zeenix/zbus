/// This is for a program that has no async runtime of its own. Put the async code in one call to
/// this function; the call blocks the thread until the future completes. In between polls of the
/// future, the calling thread also runs the tasks, sockets and timers of every connection on
/// zbus's built-in runtime, so such a program stays a single thread. If the call returns while a
/// connection is still alive, a helper thread takes over that connection's work until the next
/// call, or until the connection is gone.
///
/// Because the connections' work runs on the calling thread in between polls, the future must
/// not block that thread waiting for it. A synchronous wait for a reply, or a busy loop until a
/// signal arrives, never finishes.
///
/// Do not call this from inside a task zbus is running, such as a method of a served interface
/// or a future inside another `block_on` call. It panics there, because it would be waiting for
/// the very thread it is on. Do not call it from another runtime's task either: it blocks that
/// task's thread until the future completes, which deadlocks the program if the future needs
/// that thread to make progress.
