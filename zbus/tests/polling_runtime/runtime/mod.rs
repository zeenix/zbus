//! A runtime for a connection that runs on one thread and starts none of its own.
//!
//! Readiness comes from a `polling::Poller`, tasks from `async-task`, and timers from a map of
//! deadlines the runtime walks itself. [`Runtime::run`] drives all of it, together with the
//! caller's own future, on the thread that calls it: nothing here starts a thread, so a thread the
//! process gains while a connection is alive is a thread the connection asked for.
//!
//! [`traits::Runtime::spawn_blocking`] keeps its default, which runs each call on a std thread
//! that exits with the work. Nothing on the path these tests take reaches it, but a connection
//! on Linux or Android does have one caller: [`zbus::Connection::peer_creds`] looks the peer's
//! supplementary groups up through it, and the default would then start one short-lived thread
//! per call. A runtime with a pool of its own should override the hook rather than copy this.
