//! What is left of a runtime once the connections it ran are gone.
//!
//! A connection hands its runtime tasks, timers and sources, and each of those holds the
//! runtime's state; releasing the runtime has to give all of it back, or a process that outlives
//! one connection carries the whole of it for good. A peer-to-peer pair covers both ways a
//! connection ends: one side says goodbye, the other simply stops existing.
//!
//! What a task produced is the runtime's to release as well, which is what the other test here is
//! about: such a value is free to reach back into the runtime as it goes.
