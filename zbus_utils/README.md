# zbus_utils

This crate provides the D-Bus signature parser, the D-Bus name validators and the derive-macro
plumbing shared by [`zbus`] and [`zbus_macros`]. [`zgvariant`] shares it too, from its 2.0
release; zgvariant 1.x depends on `zvariant_utils` 4.x, this crate under its old name.

## Stability

The API is NOT expected to be stable. The crate, however, will follow semver rules: breaking changes would cause a major version bump.
